# Lease & Negotiation Refactor Summary

Date: 2025-09-26

## Objectives
- Unify inconsistent naming (snake_case → camelCase) across API responses & frontend usage.
- Correct negotiation workflow state machine (client initiation → manager review → client review → approval → signing).
- Provide safer, typed domain models (LeaseDraft, Negotiation, Lease) with explicit status unions.
- Normalize final lease creation and prevent duplicate signing.
- Add a lease draft PATCH endpoint to support client acceptance of counters and staff promotion to approval.
- Remove ad-hoc parsing / implicit JSON handling; introduce serializer for negotiation responses.
- Improve date/time formatting consistency via shared util.

## Key Changes
### Types (`src/types.ts`)
- Added canonical interfaces: `LeaseDraft`, `Negotiation`, `Lease` with `LeaseDraftStatus` and `NegotiationStatus` unions.
- Retained legacy aliases (`Lease_draft`, `negotiations`, `Leases`) temporarily for backward compatibility.

### API Routes
- `api/negotiations/route.ts` (POST/GET):
  - POST now sets draft to `manager_review` after client proposal.
  - Serializer returns camelCase fields (`proposedTerms`, `createdAt`, etc.).
  - Staff placeholder `staffId` retained due to non-null schema; flagged for future nullable migration.
- `api/negotiations/[id]/route.ts` (PATCH):
  - Implements state machine: `accept` -> draft `approved`; `counter` -> original negotiation `countered`, new pending negotiation created, draft → `client_review`.
- `api/leases/draft/route.ts` (PATCH added):
  - Supports `accept_counter` (draft → `manager_review`) and `promote_approved` (draft → `approved`).
  - Validates and updates `currentTerms` atomically.
- `api/leases/final/[id]/route.ts`:
  - Guard against duplicate finalization.
  - CamelCase response (`leaseId`, `startDate`, `draftStatus`).

### Frontend Components
- `negotiationDialog.tsx`, `negotiationHistory.tsx`, `leaseCard.tsx` updated to use camelCase negotiation fields.
- Integrated new draft PATCH workflow in `leaseCard` (UI approve → `promote_approved`).
- Added shared `formatDateTime` and `formatDate` utilities (`src/lib/utils.ts`).

### Utilities
- Added date formatting helpers for consistent display (handles invalid/null gracefully).

## Remaining Legacy Elements / Notes
- Request payloads still use snake_case keys (`draft_id`, `proposed_terms`, `response_message`) for compatibility with existing server parsing. Server accepts them and outputs camelCase. A future enhancement can introduce dual-accept parsing and migrate clients fully.
- Schema constraint: `Negotiation.staffId` is non-nullable; true null semantics (staff unassigned until response) would require a Prisma migration.
- Legacy snake_case fields (e.g. `created_at` on unrelated models) left untouched; outside current scope.

## Suggested Future Enhancements
1. Allow nullable `staffId` in `Negotiation` via schema migration.
2. Accept camelCase request body keys alongside snake_case; deprecate snake_case with warning header.
3. Add integration tests covering full lifecycle: draft creation → negotiation cycle → approval → finalization.
4. Add optimistic UI updates for negotiation submission and status transitions.
5. Introduce authorization layer tests ensuring role-based restrictions remain intact.

## Testing Performed
- Static type checks: no TypeScript errors in modified files.
- Grep audit for legacy negotiation snake_case fields; remaining matches are intentional (request bodies or unrelated models).

## Status Mapping (Old → New Behavior)
- Client proposal previously set draft to `client_review`; now `manager_review` (accurate responsibility handoff).
- Counter offer previously left draft status unchanged; now reverts to `client_review` for client decision.
- Finalization guarded against duplicate lease creation.
